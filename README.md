# WebsiteBlockerBookmarklet
Simple chrome bookmarklet that redirects or blocks websites. Redirects to a distraction-free 5-minute timer.

Why I made this:
I built this primarily for myself to fix my doomscrolling pattern. (there are many more better options online but I wanted to learn github pages by building this)

Feel free to use this if you find it helpful. I have attached simple instructions:
1. Make bookmark and copy the bookmarklet code into the bookmark's URL
2. Save the bookmark
3. Before taking a break on youtube shorts, click on the bookmark (this starts 5 min timer)
4. After 5 mins, it should redirect you.

Note: this only works on youtube SHORTS, nothing else
